This is a web-based memory game app developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game challenges players to test their memory skills by matching pairs of cards with the same image. The objective is to clear the board by finding and eliminating all the matching pairs.

## Technologies Used 

The TrackTwin is built using the following technologies:

- **HTML**: The structure and layout of the web pages are created using HTML.

- **CSS**: CSS is used for styling the user interface and making the app visually appealing.

- **JavaScript**: JavaScript is responsible for the functionality of the app, handling user interactions.

## Game Instructions

1. Launch the Memory Game App in your web browser.
2. Upon entering the app, you will be presented with two input options to customize your game experience:
   - **Pattern**: Choose the desired card arrangement pattern from the available options (2x3, 2x4, 3x4, or 4x5).
   - **Complexity Level**: Select the difficulty level for the game (Easy, Medium, or Advanced).
3. Once you have made your selections, the game board will be generated with the chosen pattern and complexity level.
4. Each card on the board will have an image on its back.
5. To play the game, click on a card to reveal the image on its back.
6. Click on a second card to reveal its image as well.
7. If the two consecutive cards have the same image, they will disappear from the board.
8. If the images on the two cards do not match, they will be flipped back over, and you can continue searching for matching pairs.
9. Repeat steps until all the cards have been cleared from the board.
10. Once all the cards have been matched and eliminated, you will be presented with a completion screen indicating that you have successfully completed the game.
